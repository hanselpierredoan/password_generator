# password_generator

I wrote this Java app that generates a random password that is 18 characters long. It uses a Random object to generate a random number between 0 and 4. Depending on the number generated, the code will add a random uppercase letter, lowercase letter, symbol, or number to the StringBuilder password. Once 18 characters have been added, the code will print out the generated password.
